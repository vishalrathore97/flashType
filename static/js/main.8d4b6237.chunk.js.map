Recent controversy aside, a slimsy downtown without perches is truly a grandson of spiry sousaphones. The bowl of a couch becomes a daring archeology. A kayak is a chill from the right perspective. If this was somewhat unclear, few can name a bifid Wednesday that isn't a loveless icicle.\",\r\n  \"Framed in a different way, a nimble insurance is a rise of the mind. A rice of the aftershave is assumed to be a contained sink. As far as we can estimate, the unkind fiction comes from a seasick latex. The literature would have us believe that a routed pedestrian is not but a ground. The velate anteater reveals itself as an unstriped cardboard to those who look. The musician of a train becomes an upward ease. It's an undeniable fact, really; a snugger toy is a romanian of the mind. Some fleshy raies are thought of simply as selections. An oval of the baby is assumed to be a shiny room.\",\r\n  \"The literature would have us believe that an upgrade workshop is not but a tabletop. A sissy liquor without bails is truly a school of awheel dungeons. Shaded landmines show us how violets can be augusts. A soda can hardly be considered an oozing otter without also being an august. One cannot separate bottoms from wrinkly periods. A math is the kilogram of a centimeter. To be more specific, a hyena is the name of a stretch. However, the bridgeless fan comes from an elapsed cucumber. Before faucets, waitresses were only parties.\",\r\n];\r\n","import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport TryAgain from \"../TryAgain/TryAgain\";\r\nimport TypingChallenge from \"../TypingChallenge/TypingChallenge\";\r\nimport { SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS } from \"./../../data/samplePara\";\r\nimport \"./TestContainer.css\";\r\n\r\nconst totalTime = 60;\r\n\r\nconst TestContainer = () => {\r\n  const [testInfo, setTestInfo] = useState([]);\r\n  const [isCompleted, setIsCompleted] = useState(false);\r\n  const [wpm, setWpm] = useState(0);\r\n  const [words, setWords] = useState(0);\r\n  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState(0);\r\n  const [timerStarted, setTimerStarted] = useState(false);\r\n  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(totalTime);\r\n  const [selectedPara, setSelectedPara] = useState(\"hi\");\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (selectedPara === \"hi\") {\r\n      const randomPara =\r\n        SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS[Math.floor(Math.random() * SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS.length)];\r\n      const letterArr = randomPara.split(\"\");\r\n      const testInfo = letterArr.map((l) => {\r\n        return { testLetter: l, status: \"notAttempted\" };\r\n      });\r\n      setSelectedPara(randomPara);\r\n      setTestInfo(testInfo);\r\n    }\r\n    let timer;\r\n    if (timerStarted) {\r\n      timer = setInterval(() => {\r\n        if (timeRemaining > 0) {\r\n          const timeSpent = totalTime - timeRemaining;\r\n          let wordPerMin;\r\n          if (timeSpent > 0) {\r\n            wordPerMin = parseInt((words / timeSpent) * 60);\r\n            setWpm(wordPerMin);\r\n          }\r\n          setTimeRemaining((prevTime) => prevTime - 1);\r\n        } else {\r\n          clearInterval(timer);\r\n        }\r\n      }, 1000);\r\n    }\r\n    return () => clearInterval(timer);\r\n  }, [timeRemaining, timerStarted]);\r\n\r\n  const handleInputChange = (input) => {\r\n    if (!timerStarted) {\r\n      setTimerStarted(true);\r\n    }\r\n    const characters = input.length;\r\n    let correctCharacters = 0;\r\n    const index = characters - 1;\r\n    const testInfoDup = [...testInfo];\r\n    let statuses = \"\";\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < selectedPara.length; i++) {\r\n      if (testInfoDup[i].testLetter === \" \") {\r\n        testInfoDup[i].status = \"space\";\r\n      } else if (i <= index) {\r\n        testInfoDup[i].status =\r\n          input[i] === selectedPara[i] ? \"correct\" : \"incorrect\";\r\n      } else {\r\n        testInfoDup[i].status = \"notAttempted\";\r\n      }\r\n      statuses += testInfoDup[i].status;\r\n      if (testInfoDup[i].status === \"correct\") correctCharacters++;\r\n    }\r\n    const wordsArr = statuses.split(\"space\");\r\n    const correctWords = wordsArr.reduce((total, next) => {\r\n      if (next.search(/(incorrect|notAttempted)/) === -1) {\r\n        total++;\r\n      }\r\n      return total;\r\n    }, 0);\r\n    setTestInfo(testInfoDup);\r\n    setWords(correctWords);\r\n    setCharacters(correctCharacters);\r\n    const isDone = !testInfoDup.some((obj) =>\r\n      [\"incorrect\", \"notAttempted\"].includes(obj.status)\r\n    );\r\n    if (isDone) setIsCompleted(true);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleRetry = () => {\r\n    fetchNewPara();\r\n    setCharacters(0);\r\n    setWords(0);\r\n    setWpm(0);\r\n    setIsCompleted(false);\r\n    setTimerStarted(false);\r\n    setTimeRemaining(60);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const fetchNewPara = () => {\r\n    const randomPara =\r\n      SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS[Math.floor(Math.random() * SAMPLE_PARAGRAPHS.length)];\r\n    const letterArr = randomPara.split(\"\");\r\n    const testInfo = letterArr.map((l) => {\r\n      return { testLetter: l, status: \"notAttempted\" };\r\n    });\r\n    setSelectedPara(randomPara);\r\n    setTestInfo(testInfo);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"test-container\">\r\n      {timeRemaining && !isCompleted > 0 ?
